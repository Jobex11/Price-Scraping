Time -> 16:45

Nextjs enables you to create a fullstack web applications by extending the  
features, and integrating powerful Rust-based javascript tooling for the  
fastest builds. 

Layout-> is allowing you to share different part of the application
across different pages. 

-> if you find any tailwind shortcuts hard to understand 
go to  [tailwind.css] to find the meaning.

-> Images and Links are imported in nextjs applications. 

-using  [ctrl + space] to  import a components.
- why we turn searchbar into a client side; 
Because we are going to be using interactivity and hooks 

-note react does'nt support the use of html images <img> 
but rather <Images /> gotten form next/image


===== TO SCRAPE OUR DATA =====

1. 1:27:00 
currentPrice is printing double values. 

2. maximum call stack exceeded usually occur when there is
